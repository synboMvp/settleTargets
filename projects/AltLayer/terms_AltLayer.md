# AltLayer Financing Terms

AltLayer has successfully completed a $10 million Series A financing round with a pre-money valuation of $80 million. The round was led by [Lead Investor] and supported by several strategic and institutional investors.

The funds raised will primarily be used for the further development of the AltLayer protocol, with a focus on enhancing the security, decentralization, interoperability, and crypto-economic fast finality of existing rollups. Additionally, the funds will be allocated to expanding the AltLayer ecosystem, establishing new partnerships, and driving the adoption of the protocol across various blockchain networks.

To ensure alignment with long-term goals, all tokens will be subject to a 12-month lock-up period, after which they will be gradually released.
