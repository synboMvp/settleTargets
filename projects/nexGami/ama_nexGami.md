# What makes NexGami (NEXG) unique?
Like many game platforms, we also have the function of displaying games so that players can find many games to play when entering the platform. What is different from them is that most of GameFi's so-called P2Es are actually Ponzi games, and we hope that they can become web3 leaders for traditional game users. Make money by leading and serving traditional game players. This feels very much like we are recruiting old web3 players to make money by contributing value, rather than just entering in advance and waiting for the taker to appear.              

In addition, our platform places great emphasis on social interaction. The cooperation of guild members in the game and the confrontation between guilds run through every game on the platform and the platform itself. Social networking is our core content, and it will also allow players to be more active, stay longer, and pay more on the platform.

# What is NexGami (NEXG) marketing strategy?

Our marketing strategy unfolds in three phases. First, we aim to captivate 800,000 to 1 million native Web3 community members, with our Twitter followers already nearing the 300,000 mark. Next, we plan to entice approximately 8 to 10 million users from the traditional gaming market, fostering a symbiotic mentorship between them and our Web3 aficionados. Web3 veterans will guide traditional gamers through the intricacies of Tokens and NFTs, while the latter will share insights on cost-effective gaming and growth strategies, thus cultivating a unique user ecosystem for our platform.    

The final phase is designed to deepen social engagement within our platform and games, encouraging the formation of numerous guild communities. Friends within the same guild collaborate and grow together, enjoying a shared gaming experience. Meanwhile, rivalries between different guilds will emerge, sparking competitive battles across various games, giving rise to a sustainable, vibrant, and financially potent user ecosystem.
