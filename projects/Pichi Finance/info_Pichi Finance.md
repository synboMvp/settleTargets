**Pichi Finance** is a **points trading protocol** that enables users to trade points from their favorite protocols **before TGE** (Token Generation Event). Pichi offers significant design improvements to the points trading process by leveraging **ERC-6551 Accounts**, also known as **Tokenbound Accounts**.

### Key Features:

- Users can create a Michi Wallet NFT, which serves as a container for tokens that earn points. This innovative approach allows for more flexible and efficient point trading.

- Pichi utilizes ERC-6551 Accounts, providing users with a dedicated wallet for their Michi Wallet NFT. This integration ensures that the points earned by tokens deposited in the wallet are securely tracked and accumulated.

- As tokens within the Michi Wallet NFT earn points, these points accumulate in the associated ERC-6551 wallet. Users have the flexibility to withdraw their points-earning tokens at any time.

- Once enough points have been accumulated in the wallet, users can choose to sell the Michi Wallet NFT. By doing so, they effectively sell the accrued points, offering a new way to monetize points before the official TGE.

### Advantages:

- Pichi Finance allows users to trade points before the TGE, providing liquidity and value to points that would otherwise be locked until the event.

- The use of ERC-6551 Accounts offers a more efficient and secure method for trading points, with the flexibility of using NFTs as the trading medium.

- Users have full control over when to withdraw their tokens or sell their Michi Wallet NFT, offering a customizable and user-friendly experience.
