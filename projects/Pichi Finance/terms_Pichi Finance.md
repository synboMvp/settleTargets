Last Updated: 26 March 2024

**1. Introduction**

These Terms of Use (these "Terms") govern your access to and use of the website athttps://michiwallet.com/ (the "Website") for the purpose of the creation, purchase and sale of "Michi Wallets" and "Tokenbound Accounts", which allows users to trade "points" issued by third party protocols/projects in a trustless manner,  as well as all software provided in connection with the foregoing (collectively, the "Services"). The Website is owned and operated by Michi Protocol Ltd, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands("Michi", "we", "us" or "our"). The marketplace platform on the Website allows users tointeract with specially-developed smart contracts that enable users to create listings of Michi Wallets for sale and/or purchase Michi Wallets in a peer-to-peer manner.   

For the purpose of these Terms:

"**Michi Wallets**" refer to unique non-fungible digital tokens, implemented or created on the Ethereum blockchain network complying with the ERC-721 standard or other similar “non-fungible” token standard, or such other blockchain network which allows for the implementation or creation of similar non-fungible tokens (the "Relevant Blockchain Network") using native smart contracts.    

"**Tokenbound Accounts**" means on-chain digital accounts/wallets implemented or created on the ERC-6551 standard, and owned by the relevant Michi Wallet.     

"**users**" include visitors, buyers or sellers on the platform.     

Users may utilise the platform and Services by linking their digital wallets on supported bridge extensions or digital wallet services such as MetaMask which allows users to purchase, store, and engage in transactions relating to digital assets. The Service allows you to create Michi Wallets for the purpose of depositing supported digital tokens and accruing "points" issued by third party protocols/projects. Users who hold Michi Wallets can create listings for owned wallets, putting the Michi Wallet up for sale (including any Tokenbound Accounts and associated points). Users interested in purchasing Michi Wallets can browse the listings on the marketplace and complete a purchase by paying the asking price in ETH,USDC or other supported digital asset.      

**ALL TRANSACTIONS INITIATED THROUGH OUR SERVICE ARE FACILITATED AND RUN BY THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL WALLET EXTENSIONS OR DIGITAL WALLET SERVICES, AND BY USING OUR SERVICES YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE APPLICABLE EXTENSIONS.**

Before you make any financial, legal, or other decisions involving Michi Wallets, you should seek independent professional advice from persons licensed and qualified in the area for which such advice would be appropriate.

b. Michi may require you to provide additional information and documents at the request of any competent authority or in case of application of any applicable law or regulation, including laws related to anti-laundering or income obtained by criminal means, or for counteracting financing of terrorism. Michi may also require you to provide additional information and documents in cases where it has reasons to believe that:    

- Your Account is being used for money laundering or for any other illegal activity;   

- You have concealed or reported false identification information and other details; or   

- Transactions effected via your Account were effected in breach of these Terms.

- you do not have the right, except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercialise any elements of the Content (including, without limitation, any art) without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold in our sole and absolute discretion; and

- you will not apply for, register, or otherwise use or attempt to use any Michi trademarks or service marks, or any confusingly similar marks, anywhere in the world without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold at our sole and absolute discretion.

c. All user transactions that take place between users on the Website, including without limitation creating, purchasing, selling, listing, or confirming, are facilitated via smart contracts existing on the Relevant Blockchain Network, and are initiated, managed and confirmed via such Relevant Blockchain Network at the complete risk of users. You understand that your public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction with other users on the Website.

**4. Role of Michi**

a. The Website solely provides a visual user interface allowing users to interact with each other. The role of Michi is expressly limited to making the Website and platform available, and maintaining it for users to engage directly in a peer-to-peer manner. Michi is solely an introducer and not an agent or fiduciary for any user, seller or buyer for any purpose. Michi is not responsible for the actual sale of any Michi Wallets and does not control the information provided by any protocol/project, user, seller or buyer, nor their acts or omissions; Michi is independent from all such parties. No partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by the operation of the Website, platform or Services. 

b. The Website, platform and Services facilitate the creation of Michi Wallets and trading of Michi Wallets between users, but neither Michi nor any affiliate acts as the custodian of any Michi Wallets. You understand and acknowledge that Michi is a non-custodial service provider which allows users to interact directly in a peer-to-peer manner without any involvement or actions taken by Michi or any third-party; accordingly the platform and smart contracts do not give Michi custody, possession, or control of any Michi Wallets or digital asset at any time.

c. In particular, the legally binding contract for each sale of Michi Wallets is concluded directly between users (i.e. between a buyer and a seller of Michi Wallets). The legality of, enforceability of and regulatory restrictions applicable to such contracts depend on numerous variables, including without limitation each respective party's country of residence. Users are responsible for understanding and ensuring that the sale of Michi Wallets are executed in accordance with all national and/or international laws and standards applicable to the sale of Michi Wallets. Michi cannot assume any responsibility for sales of Michi Wallets, the underlying transaction of funds or points, or the actions or identity of any user to such a contract. Any disputes regarding any Michi Wallets, terms of sales or payment/refunds shall be solely between users.

d. References, links or referrals to or connections with or reliance on third-party resources, products, services or content, including smart contracts developed or operated by third parties, may be provided to you in connection with Michi Wallets. In addition, third parties may offer promotions related to Michi Wallets or points. Michi does not endorse or assume any responsibility for any activities of or resources, products, services, content or promotions owned, controlled, operated or sponsored by third parties or any protocols/projects. If you access any such resources, products, services or content or participate in any such promotions, you do so solely at your own risk. You hereby expressly waive and release Michi from all liability arising from your use of any such resources, products, services or content or participation in any such promotions. You further acknowledge and agree that Michi shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such resources, products, services, content or promotions from third parties or any protocols/projects.

c. Save as described herein, Michi is not able to control the transfer or contents of any specific Michi Wallet. Once a Michi Wallet is created, an immutable ownership record is created and maintained on the Relevant Blockchain Network. The right to transfer and/or modify such Michi Wallets is retained solely by the current holder of the Michi Wallet as identified by such immutable ownership record (for the avoidance of doubt, such holder is not Michi given that it is a non-custodial platform) and is not within the technical control of Michi.

a. You shall pay to Michi all service fees and other charges ("Fees") determined from time to time in the sole discretion of Michi in connection with the creation, purchase, sale or transfer of Michi Wallets. 

b. In addition, all transactions on the Website which require interaction with the Relevant Blockchain Network will require "gas" fees to be paid to third-party miners/validators on such Relevant Blockchain Network as consideration for their services in confirming such blockchain transactions, which shall be borne by you. 

c. All fees and commissions must be paid in the amounts and in the manner notified to you via a checkbox prior to confirming any transaction.

**8. Disclaimers**

THE SERVICE, CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN, AND MICHI WALLETS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS AT YOUR SOLE RISK WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. MICHI (AND ITS SUPPLIERS) MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT: (A) THE SERVICES OR MICHI WALLETS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; (B) THE SERVICES OR MICHI WALLETS WILL BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS; OR (C) THE SERVICES OR MICHI WALLETS WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, COMPLETE, LEGAL, OR SAFE; (D) THE WEBSITE OR ANY CONTENT, SERVICES, OR FEATURES MADE AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE WEBSITE, OR MICHI WALLETS ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR (E) THAT ANY DATA THAT YOU DISCLOSE WHEN YOU USE THE WEBSITE WILL BE SECURE, AND YOU ACCEPT THE INHERENT SECURITY RISKS OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DEALING ONLINE OVER THE INTERNET, AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY UNLESS IT IS DUE TO OUR WILFUL DEFAULT. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS MAKE NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES REGARDING THE WEBSITE, THE SERVICES AND MICHI WALLETS (OR ANY PART HEREOF), INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, OR RELIABILITY.

 

**9. Assumption of Risk**

You accept and acknowledge:

a. Michi has no responsibility for the Michi Wallets created or traded by users of the Website and does not investigate the Michi Wallets or associated points, and so it cannot provide any guarantee, warranty or assurance regarding the authenticity, uniqueness, originality, quality, marketability, legality or value of any Michi Wallets or associated points. YOU BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR VERIFYING THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, AND AUTHENTICITY OF MICHI WALLETS AND ASSOCIATED POINTS THAT YOU PURCHASE ON MICHI. NOTWITHSTANDING INDICATORS AND MESSAGES THAT SUGGEST VERIFICATION, MICHI MAKES NO CLAIMS ABOUT THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, OR AUTHENTICITY OF MICHI WALLETS OR ASSOCIATED POINTS ON THE PLATFORM.

b. The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the Michi Wallets or associated points, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of Michi Wallets will not lose money. 

c. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactionsrelating to Michi Wallets. Michi is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to such transactions.

d. Our Service does not store, send, or receive Michi Wallets or associated points. This is because Michi Wallets and associated points exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Relevant Blockchain Network. Any creation or transfer of title that might occur in any Michi Wallets or associated points occurs on the Relevant Blockchain Network, and not in connection with the Services. Michi cannot control such process nor guarantee that it, or any party can effect the transfer of such title or right to any Michi Wallets or associated points.

e. Michi Wallets and associated points, any associated transfers or marketplaces for the same utilise smart contract and blockchain technology, including non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrencies, and decentralized or peer-to-peer networks and systems. Users acknowledge and agree that such technologies are experimental, speculative, and inherently risky. There are risks associated with utilising or interacting with digital assets, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorised access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that Michi will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using Michi Wallets, however caused. 

f. There may be various vulnerabilities, failures or abnormal behaviour of software or Michi Wallets (e.g., wallet, smart contracts for creating or transferring Michi Wallets), or relating to the relevant Blockchain Network, and Michi cannot be responsible for any losses in connection with the same, including without limitation any losses in connection with (i) user error, such as forgotten passwords or incorrectly construed smart contracts or other transactions, (ii) server failure or data loss, (iii) corrupted wallet files, or (iv) unauthorised access or activities by third parties, including but not limited to the use of viruses, phishing, brute-forcing or other means of attack against the Website, the relevant Blockchain Network, or your digital wallet.

g. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility or value of Michi Wallets.

h. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the Servicesand the utility of Michi Wallets.

i. The Services will rely on third-party supported bridge extensions or digital wallet services to perform the transactions for the Services or Michi Wallets. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms; or if any of such platforms loses market share or falls out of favour or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Services will suffer.

 

**10. Limitation of Liability**

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL MICHI BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFIT OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM THESE TERMS, THE SERVICES, MICHI WALLETS, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DIGITAL ASSETS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF MICHI HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SERVICES, PRODUCTS OR THIRD PARTY SITES AND PRODUCTS ARE ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK.

 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN,SAVE IN THE CASE OF PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF MICHI ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THESE TERMS, THE SERVICE, THE WEBSITE OR MICHI WALLETS EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FEES ACTUALLY PAID TO MICHI IN RESPECT OF SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU (WHICH FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE PURCHASE PRICE OF MICHI WALLETS THAT ARE PAID TO THE SELLER).

 Users are required to initiate any procedure for claims in connection with these Terms or the Services within twelve (12) months from the date when the damage was suffered.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal injury claims.

 

**11. Modifications to the Service**

We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services or Michi Wallets (or any features or parts thereof) at any time and without liability therefore.

 

**12. Governing Law and Venue**

b. You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Service, to any products sold or distributed through the Service, or to any aspect of your relationship with Michi, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that Michi may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).

d. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A OR COLLECTIVE CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
