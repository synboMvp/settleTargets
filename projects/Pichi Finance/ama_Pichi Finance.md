Pichi is a trustless points protocol, allowing users to trade points from leading protocols pre-TGE. Pichi utilizes ERC-6551 (Tokenbound) Accounts which are owned by NFTs. Trading the NFT transfers custody of the account along with any points accrued to that account.   

Pichi Wallet owners can list wallets for sale and points buyers can view listed wallets. Each listed wallet will give a full breakdown of points earned and what types of assets earned these points. Additional data such as a Time vs Points Balance graph and detailed views of wallet transactions will be shown to further visualize when points were earned.   

Pichi Marketplace sales will be peer-to-peer and fully trustless. Once a wallet is purchased, the buyer can view the Michi Wallet within their dashboard and have full access to any airdrops or incentives distributed to this wallet. Listings and offers will be created via EIP-712 signatures stored within the Michi database.

# What makes Pichi Finance (PICHI) unique?
Our project is unique because it utilizes the ERC-6551 contract, making it trustless to trade points, with no collateral at all. When points are traded, the points and wallet are fully transferred, along with custody of the account.   

There is a competitor called Whales Market - however, sellers and buyers require collateral, and also, they might also renege upon their trade of the points upon TGE - which is what we are trying to solve.
