**Acceptance of the Terms of Use**

These Terms of Use are entered into by and between you and Yield Guild Games Association (" YGG ," " we ," " our ," or us"). The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, " Terms of Use"), govern your access to and use of https://yieldguild.io and https://yieldguild.games (the " Sites") including any content, functionality, and Services (defined below) offered on or through the Sites and blockchain Metaverse (collectively, the " Platform"). Only users who have registered with YGG with their email address can use the Services (a " registered user"). Any user who has not registered will only have viewing access to the publicly accessible parts of the Sites as a guest (an " unregistered user").

Please read these Terms of Use carefully before you start to use the Platform. By using the Platform or by clicking to accept or agree to these Terms of Use when this option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy, found at https://yieldguild.io/privacy-policy, incorporated herein by reference. If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Platform.

This Platform is offered and available to persons who are thirteen (13) years of age or older. By using this Platform, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with YGG and meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Platform.

If you are agreeing to these Terms of Use on behalf of an entity, you hereby represent and warrant that you have all necessary permissions and authority to agree to these Terms of Use and to bind the entity to them.

**Definitions**

The following terms as used herein shall have the following meanings:

* " Agreement" means the terms of your Enrollment Form and these Terms of Use.
* " DAO" a decentralized autonomous organization is a blockchain-based protocol with rules enforced by smart contracts, which are programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. DAOs can have several purposes, but their main function is to provide an automated way to carry out governance decisions voted on by their members using a governance token. A DAO's activities are borderless and entirely transparent through the blockchain.
* " Discord" means https://discord.com/invite/ygg.
* " Enrollment Form" means the online enrollment, signup, or registration form completed by a registered user and which refers to these Terms of Use, and which may set out additional commercial terms that will govern the relationship between such registered user and YGG.
* " Game Partner" means a person or entity who offers a game compatible with and connected to the Platform and possesses the appropriate rights to do so.
* " Player" means a registered user who plays a game in connection with the Platform.
* " Metaverse" refers to an expansive, interconnected, virtual world wherein people can recreate many of the things they do in real life and more. These activities include building, buying, selling, owning, socializing, entertaining, working, learning, and so on.
* " NFT" means a non-fungible token supported by a blockchain network, subject to smart contracts. An NFT is a unique, immutable, and verifiable representation of a physical or digital item on a blockchain. This technology allows important concepts of physical ownership, such as provenance and authentication, to be transferred digitally. In video games, NFTs also open up the potential for in-game assets to be interoperable with a range of different games and platforms.
* " Profile" means a registered user's profile on the Platform, which is available to link additional wallets, social media accounts, and game accounts that Players can then share with other registered users. While the Profile is public, registered users can manage their linked wallets or accounts from their setting page, which will be private to each registered user.
* " YGG Token" means YGG's native token.
**Services**

* Generally. The Platform is a cross-game, Player acquisition, engagement, and retention platform, that helps balance game economies and drive beneficial in-game interactions. The Platform shall provide the registered users various services, which may include, but are not limited to, hosting registered user Profile pages and associated content, assistance with delivery, payments, and access to and use of the Platform for all authorized registered users (collectively, the " Services"). The Platform may also provide services to or serve content related to games, game groups, and YGG for the ultimate purpose of providing the Services.
* Clearance. Registered users acknowledge and agree that access to the Services via the Platform may be subject to a review of each such registered user's background, which may include obtaining a consumer report, know-your-customer, and anti-money laundering requirements, among other items necessary for YGG's legal obligations and protection of the registered users on the Platform. As much as possible, We will refrain from asking for this sort of information and will only do so to the minimum extent required to provide the Services. Registered users further acknowledge and agree to provide YGG with written consent and authorization to perform any of the foregoing, and registered users will complete any and all necessary documents (e.g., Enrollment Form) required by YGG to complete the review of each such registered user's background. YGG reserves the right to admit or deny any registered user to the Platform for any or no reason.
* Changes, Delays, Unavailability. YGG reserves the right to alter, suspend, or discontinue the Services or the Platform at any time and for any reason or no reason without any liability to registered users. In such cases, YGG will endeavor to give notice of such changes, delay, or unavailability. The Services may be unavailable from time to time due to maintenance or malfunction of computer or network equipment or other reasons.
* Consent to be Contacted by YGG and Game Partners. Each registered user consents, when making their account, to be contacted by YGG for the purposes of the Services of the Platform, including for marketing of YGG products and services. Email will only be used for authentication and internal YGG marketing purposes, absent a specific consent otherwise. Each Player also consents to YGG sharing their contact information with the Game Partner during a campaign or otherwise. The Game Partner may contact each Player to the extent of the consent, which the Player can revoke with the Game Partner. No registered user's contact information shall be sold to third-parties. For more information, please see our Privacy Policy.
**The Platform**

* YGG is a gaming guild that coordinates Players around the world to earn crypto-based rewards in play-to-earn games or similar earn activities. It also purchases NFTs, such as in-game assets and virtual land, and makes them available for guild members to borrow. YGG is made up of different community members including, without limitation, registered users, Players, and Community Managers who help each other get onboarded and earn income through play-to-earn. The YGG DAO community exists in the Metaverse and meets on Discord to share ideas and discuss strategies with registered users and communities across the globe.
* Play-to-earn is a new category in video gaming that rewards Players for winning battles and completing tasks with NFTs, tokens, or other cryptocurrency-based rewards, which they are free to use in-game or trade on an open market. The amount of money that can be earned depends on several factors, including the Player's skill, how much time they spend playing the game, their win rate, and the price movements of in-game tokens and assets on the open market.
* In NFT games, in-game assets are wholly owned by the Players, not the game's developer. These gaming-based NFTs may include characters, plots of virtual land, weapons, etc. They can be used inside blockchain games to earn yield in the form of tokens or other rewards, which can be used in-game or traded on an open market for other cryptocurrencies or fiat money.
* In decentralized game economies, there is an entire ecosystem of Players who buy, sell, and trade in-game items between each other. They are able to do this because NFTs and cryptocurrencies provide the Players with digital property rights for their in-game assets. Thus, the Players actually become part-owners in the game and get to share in the value that the community creates.
* YGG has set up reward vaults so that registered users can more meaningfully contribute to the success and development of various games associated with YGG. The vaults reward registered users with a variety of game tokens in exchange for staking their YGG Tokens. This provides game access to those with YGG Tokens and greater exposure to these games so that the Player does not have to buy tokens for each game. The reward vaults are similarly valuable to YGG's Game Partners as they both distribute their game tokens to a greater audience and further integrate the YGG community with theirs.
* Features.
1„ÄÅThe Platform has several distinct features, including but not limited to, the dashboard, inventory, achievements (where registered users can view the achievements of other Players as well as their own), reward vault (where registered users can stake their YGG Tokens for in-game tokens and which has its own Terms of Use), and tokens (where registered users can view the contents of their wallet).

2„ÄÅRegistered users can sign up to the Platform using their email and a magic link.

3„ÄÅUse Guidelines. Registered users shall not:

* license, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, time share, or otherwise exploit or make the Services or the Platform available to any third-party without YGG's prior written consent, which may be withheld in its sole discretion;

**Governing Law and Jurisdiction**

These Terms of Use will be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Switzerland, without giving effect to choice of law provisions. Each party waives any right it may have to assert the doctrine of forum non conveniens, to assert that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of such arbitration or courts or to object to venue to the extent any proceeding is brought in accordance herewith.

**Disputes**

Any dispute, controversy, claim, or difference of whatever nature arising out of, relating to, or having any connection with these Terms of Use, including a dispute regarding the existence, formation, validity, interpretation, performance, or termination of these Terms of Use or the consequences of its nullity and also including any dispute relating to any non-contractual rights or obligations arising out of, relating to, or having any connection with these Terms of Use or the Platform (a " Dispute") shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Swiss Rules of International Arbitration of the Swiss Chambers' Arbitration Institution (" SCAI") in force on the date when a party sends a Notice of Arbitration to another and is submitted in accordance with the SCAI rules. The number of arbitrators shall be one (1) or three (3), in the discretion of YGG; the seat of the arbitration shall be in Zug, Switzerland or remote; the arbitral proceedings shall be conducted in English, with the following exceptions to such rules if in conflict: (a) each party to the arbitration will pay an equal share of the expenses and fees of the arbitrator, together with other expenses of the arbitration incurred or approved by the arbitrator; and (b) arbitration may proceed in the absence of any party if written notice (pursuant to SCAI rules and regulations) of the proceedings has been given to such party. The parties agree to abide by all decisions and awards rendered in such proceedings. Such decisions and awards rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and conclusive. All such controversies, claims, or disputes shall be decided in this manner in lieu of any action at law or equity. ANY SUCH DISPUTE SHALL EXCLUSIVELY BE REFERRED TO THE COURTS COMPETENT FOR THE CITY OF ZUG, SWITZERLAND IF ARBITRATION IS INEFFECTIVE. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use in the courts referred to in this Section. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
