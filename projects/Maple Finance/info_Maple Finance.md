**Maple Finance** is an **on-chain institutional capital marketplace** that offers undercollateralized loans to institutional borrowers while providing fixed-income opportunities for lenders. By enabling capital efficiency in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, Maple Finance facilitates a more flexible and accessible lending environment for institutions.

The protocol is governed by the **Maple Token (MPL)**, which plays a central role in its ecosystem. MPL token holders have the ability to participate in governance, influencing key decisions regarding the protocol's development and operations. In addition to governance rights, MPL holders share in the fee revenues generated by the platform, creating a direct financial incentive for active participation.

Moreover, MPL holders can also **stake insurance** in **Lending Pools**. By doing so, they provide an additional layer of security for the platform, ensuring that lenders are protected against potential defaults. This staking mechanism aligns the interests of MPL holders with the overall health and stability of the Maple Finance ecosystem.

In summary, Maple Finance not only bridges the gap between traditional institutional finance and decentralized finance but also empowers its community through a robust governance and staking model, underpinned by the Maple Token.
