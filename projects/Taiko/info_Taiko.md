**Taiko** is a decentralized Ethereum-equivalent **ZK-EVM** and general-purpose **ZK-Rollup**. Its purpose is to enable developers and users of **dApps** developed for **Ethereum L1** to use them on **Taiko** without any modifications. Therefore, **dApps** can be quickly deployed to **L2**, preserving **Ethereum's security** while incurring **lower transaction fees** than on **L1**.

### Key Features:

- **Decentralization**: Taiko is built with a focus on decentralization, ensuring that no single entity has control over the network.
  
- **Ethereum-Equivalent**: As a ZK-EVM, Taiko maintains full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing for seamless deployment of smart contracts developed for Ethereum.
  
- **ZK-Rollup Technology**: Taiko leverages ZK-Rollup, a scaling solution that batches multiple transactions into a single proof, significantly reducing the cost of transactions while maintaining the same level of security as the Ethereum mainnet.
  
- **No Modifications Required**: Developers can deploy their existing Ethereum dApps on Taiko without any changes, making it easy to migrate and scale on L2.

- **Lower Transaction Fees**: By operating on L2, Taiko offers reduced transaction costs compared to Ethereum L1, making it a cost-effective solution for both developers and users.
