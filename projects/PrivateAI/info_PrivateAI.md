# What is PrivateAI (PGPT)?
PrivateAI is pioneering the intersection of AI and decentralized science (DeSci) by offering a platform where data owners and producers can securely upload, showcase, and monetize their data. Aimed at researchers, AI engineers, and institutions, it transforms the way AI interprets and utilizes research data, unlocking valuable insights, transforming those data into research graphs and fostering innovation across various scientific domains. Through its peer-to-peer Data-as-a-Service model, PrivateAI facilitates a collaborative ecosystem for data analysis, enhancing the discovery process and ensuring fair compensation for contributors, thereby revolutionizing scientific research and data utilization for the greater good.

**Uncovering Hidden Relationships**

PrivateAI's knowledge graphs are revolutionizing scientific research by uncovering hidden relationships within vast data sets, a feat impossible for the human eye. Our advanced neural networks empower researchers with unprecedented insights, accelerating breakthroughs in disease understanding and longevity. This technology transforms complex information into actionable intelligence, accelerating the path to groundbreaking discoveries. With PrivateAI, the scientific community gains a powerful tool, turning data into a catalyst for innovation and progress in health and science.   

# What makes PrivateAI (PGPT) unique?

PrivateAI plans to solve the current problems facing in the domain of AI for DeSci:

* The lack of tools for data visualization, which aids in processing and understanding information faster. Scientific research is not being indexed on common search engines like Google.
* The time consumed when analyzing multi-source analysis and interconnecting all facts across multiple sources.
* The need for a common peer-collaboration scientific platform.
* Current platforms are non-rewarding and do not incentivize data owners to share data.

Below, we look at recent projects which are offering a similar solution and what makes the PrivateAI stand out: 

**Competitor analysis**

* **Vector Space Biosciences:**
* Pros: Builds knowledge graphs using correlations and embeddings, AI model detects hidden relations.
* Cons: Dataset is limited to proteins, publications only from PubMed, community of researchers can upload research on the platform but the graph is built based on the uploaded paper.
* **Why PrivateAI is better**: there is a community of researchers, user can upload the research on the platform, graph is built based on the uploaded paper, better UX/UI
* **Ocean Protocol Foundation Ltd.**:
* Pros: Share and monetize data, rich metadata descriptions for data assets.
* Cons: Hard to understand where to start for researchers, targets only data scientists, data quality not monitored, any scientific data available but update frequency is low, promotes * compatibility with Semantic Web technologies tied to knowledge graphs but does not directly incorporate knowledge graphs.
* **Why PrivateAI is better**: any scientific data is available, trusted sources by controlling the content, graph is built based on the uploaded paper, easy to understand the logic of the ecosystem.
* **Fetch.ai**:
* Pros: Open source framework, AI agents that can be programmed and monetized.
*  Cons: Complex for regular scientists to understand, needs technical expertise to run an agent, does not directly incorporate knowledge graphs as a core component.
* **Why PrivateAI is better**: does directly incorporate knowledge graphs as a core component of its technology stack, no need for additional configuration set up, the discovery of relevant data, and easy to understand the data representation.
* **Insilico**:
* Pros: Focus on drug discovery, vast biomedical data, clearly extracted knowledge graphs and entities, advanced AI techniques, internal drug development.
* Cons: No focus on data monetization for scientists, no workable version of the product open to scientists, AI implementation and knowledge graph unclear.
* **Why PrivateAI is better**: clearly extracted knowledge graphs and entities, publicly open to the science community, any domain science is acceptable, targets not only pharma.
* **OriginalTrail**:
* Pros: Ensures integrity of supply chain data, clear audit trail of data changes and interactions, integration with existing enterprise systems like ERP and IoT devices.
* Cons: Low usability of built graphs, no search capabilities, current focus only on supply chain, concept and graph inconsistency/non-comprehensible.
* **Why PrivateAI is better**: high usability of built graphs, search capabilities within knowledge base, open to community, knowledge graphs consistency.

Generalizing the the competitive advantages over the main competitors, we can claim that PrivateAI:   

* Is a knowledge graph system and underlying knowledge base closing the gaps of privacy by implementing Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) which is our primary advantage
* Provides true data privacy and full ability to manage, export and delete data within their ecosystems, has Privacy-by-design methodology in its core and ensures minimal data retention and strict access controls and an ability to manage and delete data.
* Utilizes federated learning techniques, enabling more secure and efficient AI model training while maintaining user privacy, unlike competitors that rely on centralized data processing.
* Employs secure enclave storage, Confidential Machine Learning (ConfML) and Tendermint-based consensus to achieve a decentralized, privacy-preserving AI platform by ensuring secure data handling and consensus among nodes.
* Focuses on ecosystem development, where data can be securely shared and will cover a much wider scope adapted to research teams collaboration. e.g. relation recognition feature with building a common knowledge model.

Unlike competitors, for preserving data privacy PrivateAI is trying to close two main tasks:   

* Incorporate FHE into ML with reasonable speed of work
* Multi user data encryption keys and decryption of results with security of master data.

For FHE purpose PrivateAI intends to use the Concrete ML framework developed by Zama. They have provided tools for converting scikit-learn AI models for inference (such as linear and tree-based ML models, neural networks with simple architecture) into their FHE-supported analogs. Concrete ML implies the so-called TFHE protocol - fast FHE over the Torus. It is the most performative FHE approach nowadays, which allows encrypting information for relatively short timeframes with low resource consumption.   

**How is PrivateAI unique and better vs the solutions offered currently?**

Undeniably, knowledge graphs are essential in streamlining vast sets of data, interlinking information, and using AI to reconstruct visually analyzable and easily readable information for the user. The concept of knowledge graphs extends beyond showing the connections between the data sources as a whole, but more so between the entities within them, which provide much more important information - and this is what weâ€™re building. Data owners will be able to monetize their data and peer-reviews will be incentivized.

At PrivateAI, we understand the core functionality of knowledge graphs and how users engage with large sets of data and will be providing concise information about the platform organization to our community and receiving feedback from them. We have a transparent development approach involving our DeSci community to build a fully functioning graph system together and to create a better experience in scientific research.

The project exploits the NLP AI model to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE). For that purpose a combination of two AI models - SpaCy (NLP library that provides entity recognition for extracting triplets of knowledge graph) and Rebel (identify and extract relationships between entities within text) are implemented. The combination strengthens the representation of comprehensive and accurate representation of knowledge graphs uploaded to the platform scientific papers.

The demand for such a product stems from the increased demand in expanding AI in language learning- which transcends to potentially accelerate the pace of medical discovery, expediting scientific progress and advancements. Of course, the most crucial factor is giving broader access to scientific research data.
